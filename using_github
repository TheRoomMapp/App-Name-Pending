Hey everyone I made a guide to walk us through the process of cloning and pushing file to github via terminal. 


1. clone the  master files to your computer.
- First create a folder on your pc where you want to put all of the files from github.
- In terminal cd to the folder you just made
- type: git clone http://<repository address>
- eg:  $  git clone https://github.com/TheRoomMapp/App-Name-Pending

1B. clone a specific branch to your computer
- in terminal cd to the folder you want the branch in
- type : git clone -b <branch name> --single-branch <repository name> <the location of the folder on your computer>
- eg: git clone -b James --single-branch https://github.com/TheRoomMapp/App-Name-Pending '/home/james/projects/' 


2. Great you should now have the files on your computer
-check to make sure the files are actually there
-cd into the new files
-eg: cd App-Name-Pending
-check git status
-eg: $ git status

3. Add your files after making changes
- use git add
- eg: $ git add .
- note the space period after add.

4. Commit your changes
- if you have files to upload you can do so with git commit
- git commit
- eg: $ git commit -m “A message describing what you have done”
- the -m indicates you are adding a message

5. Use git status again
- eg: $ git status
- this lets you check to make sure it worked

6. Push the files to github so everyone can see what you did. 
- use git push
- eg: $ git push
- your files should have been sent to github
