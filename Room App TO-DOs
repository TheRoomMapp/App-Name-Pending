Room App TO-DOs

Finding Data: 
Use SFU API
Create a spreadsheet based on this data to implement into our program 
Ask for Blueprints (Nora)

Room Criteria:

Geographical area 
Potentially locked rooms 
Size of class 
Amount of time it will be empty

Javascript/HTML/CSS
Learn...lol
Start developing website 

Departments data page: http://www.sfu.ca/bin/wcm/course-outlines?2018/fall
To-do list:

Manipulate courseSchedule - everyone 
Save data into file (csv, json?) -Eric
Rooms with events -later
Save exceptions, manually debug, extend timeout error -Sean
Front-end: (Nora, James, Sean, Eric, Cyndy)
Learn django
What sql


To-do list:
Dictionary version (saved as “Dictionary Version” in master branch):
Test with full data set (I’ve only tested the code pulling course schedule using a sample data set)
Function to save to file
List of url’s causing errors
Decide how to structure course schedule data
Resolve issues in list_of_everything.csv and list_of_section_exceptions. For example:
Why are most of the CA courses in list_of_everything.csv missing course numbers
CA 357W should have course number D100 but it’s not on list_of_everything (http://www.sfu.ca/outlines.html?2018/fall/ca/357w/d100)
Why is ‘CA Theatre II’ being recorded as a course (as seen on list_of_section_exceptions)
Decrease time complexity
Since our code is so slow, Eric added functions to save the data to CSV files so we only have to run the program once at the beginning of every semester but if you still want to work on making the code more efficient, I’ve listed some of my suggestions below
While loop for search functions
Avoid nested loops where possible (including loops that call functions that use loops)
Consider how to mark rooms being used for events as “full”
Increase time duration before time out error
Send and receive data from website
Create list(?) of when rooms are available
